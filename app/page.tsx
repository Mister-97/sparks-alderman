More than ten years of service has shown that real progress happens when residents and leaders work together to deliver solutions. Leadership should not stand apart from the community. It should be part of the work.\n\nWe will build on programs that serve our neighbors and expand what is working across the ward. That means investing in youth mentorship and development that prepares young people for careers, adulthood, and leadership. It means improving mental health support and crisis response training for families and community members. We will continue supporting violence prevention efforts that connect young people to safety and opportunity. We will care for public spaces where everyone feels welcome and create inclusive environments where entrepreneurs can grow, and neighbors can gather. Every person deserves a ward where they feel supported and share responsibility for the future we are building together.",

Development is not progress if the people and businesses that helped build this neighborhood are pushed out. It is not successful if families still have to leave the community to find the things they need or the places they want to enjoy.\n\nWe support growth that respects where we have come from, protects the neighbors who are here today, and opens doors for the future.
